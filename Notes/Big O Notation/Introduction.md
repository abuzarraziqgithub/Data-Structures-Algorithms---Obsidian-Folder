- Imagine we have multiple Implementations(Code) of the same function.
- How can we determine which one is the best (and in what sense)?



- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs.

  Suppose we want to write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 up to number n.
  - Implementation of the Programs are in Code Folder.
