```
function revStr(str){
let rev = [];
for(let i = str.length; i--){
rev.push[i]
}
}
```



"wouldn't be nice if there was a sort of a system for classifying code or comparing it"

"we can assign generalize labels to our code" "we can have a numeric representation of the performance of code."

"How do we walk through our code and actually talk in general terms about which code is better without having to go with time, It's not a bad idea"
"It would be cool if there was another way that didn't involve having to set up a new file and go through the process of timing our code  (what if our code takes an hour comparing to another algorithm that take about 4 hours, I don't wanna have to run it or test to figure it out comparing which code is faster, we wanna be able to assign a value to in general terms, talk about code compares to other code without having to go through all of this) and that's where big o notation comes in"

"We shouldn't be going to the detail of every operation in the code, because all that matter is the genera terms of things, very fuzzy overview "
